I'd be happy to help you understand how to set up protected routes with Clerk in your application. Let's look at how to implement this properly.
When using Clerk for authentication and wanting to create protected routes, you'll need to use their middleware and route protection features. Here's how to set it up:
First, you'll need to have Clerk properly installed in your application. Then you can implement protected routes in a few different ways depending on your framework:
For Next.js applications (which seems most likely based on the Clerk docs link you shared):

Create a middleware file to handle route protection:

tsxCopy// middleware.ts
import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default authMiddleware({
  // Routes that can be accessed while signed out
  publicRoutes: ["/", "/sign-in", "/sign-up", "/api/webhook/clerk"],
  
  // Routes that can always be accessed, and have
  // no authentication information
  ignoredRoutes: ["/api/public"],
});

// This configuration specifies which routes the middleware will run on
export const config = {
  matcher: ["/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)", "/", "/(api|trpc)(.*)"],
};

For individual components that should only be visible to authenticated users, you can use the auth() function:

tsxCopyimport { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";

export default function Dashboard() {
  // Get the user's auth status
  const { userId } = auth();
  
  // If the user is not authenticated, redirect to the sign-in page
  if (!userId) {
    redirect("/sign-in");
  }
  
  // Render the protected content
  return <div>This is a protected dashboard page</div>;
}
For React Router applications:
jsxCopyimport { ClerkProvider, SignedIn, SignedOut, RedirectToSignIn } from "@clerk/clerk-react";
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Routes, useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

function ProtectedRoute({ children }) {
  return (
    <>
      <SignedIn>{children}</SignedIn>
      <SignedOut>
        <RedirectToSignIn />
      </SignedOut>
    </>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider publishableKey="your_publishable_key">
      <BrowserRouter>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<PublicPage />} />
          <Route path="/sign-in/*" element={<SignInPage />} />
          <Route 
            path="/dashboard" 
            element={
              <ProtectedRoute>
                <DashboardPage />
              </ProtectedRoute>
            } 
          />
        </Routes>
      </BrowserRouter>
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}
Would you like me to provide more specific examples based on your particular framework or application structure?RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
